1) What is Review, Walkthrow, Insepction?

Reviews:
----------
	It is performed in verification level
	It is formal review within team	
	Reviews like ( Requirement, desgin, coding,test data,test case reviews)		
Walkthorws:
-----------
	It is performed in verification level
	It is informal meeting
	When ever we need, we just conduct walkthorw with in team

Insepction:
-------------
	It is performed in verification level
	It is formal review within team
	It is peoper schdule meeting with in team
	High level of management people will involve this section.


2) What is QA and QC and QE

	QA					QC

1) QA- Quality Analysts			QC-Quality Controller

2) QA morely focus on Process		QC morely focus on product

3) prevention of find out defect	Detecting bug after the product build

4) QA involve full SDLC lifecycle 	QC involve Testing phase only.

5) High level management peoeple	Most of the time Testers are involve
	involve in QA
6) QA is focus building the Quality	QC is testing the quality



QE : Quality Enginner


When comes to QE it's more involvement of automation tester. who wrote the automation scripts

The tester who wrote and execute the automation testing code.


3) What are the Level of Testing is there?

	1) Unit Testing
	2) Integration Testing
	3) System testing
	4) UAT Testing

4) Expalin about unit testing
	
	Unit testing:
	-----------------
		Unit testing is nothing but to test one module or peace of software to be tested by developer
		The developer who wrote the code. he test the flow of the particular module
		The developer who wrote the code, he conduct the meeting and review him code it self.
		It is white box testing technique.	
	Unit testing Techniques:
	------------------------
		1) Basic path testing
		2) control structure
		3) conditional statement
		4) looping statements
		5)mutation(Repetation) testing.


5) Expain about Integration Testing

	Integration Testing:
	--------------------
		Integration testing means to integrate one or more module and test the data flow of the module
		It is also coduacted by developer point of view
		It is also White box testing technique.


	There are two types of integration testing:
	------------------------------------------
	Incremental testing
	Non-incremental testing

	Incremental testing:
	---------------------
			we have done the incremental testing with 2 different levels.Incermental adding new module.

			1) Topdown apporach
			--------------------
					Adding new module which is child of the current module.
			2) Bottomup apporach
			---------------------
					Adding new module which is parent of the current module.


	Non-Incremental testing:
	-------------------------
			It is also type of integration testing
			It is tested with whole module at a time
			While doing non-incremental testing we may miss lot of module and fuctional testing.	
			Found the Defect is not easy in Non-Incremental testing.		

6) Expalin about System testing
		
		System Testing:
		------------------
			System testing is the process of actual tester involves.
			System testing is mainly focus on complete software not for coding part
			It is Black box testing
			Before conducting system testing we must now customer requirments.
			
			It is mainly focus on :
				
				1) GUI Testing		-	It is mainly focus on GUI base test the elements
				2) Funtional Testing	-	It is mainly focus on funtionality of the software
				3) Non-Funtional Testing-	It is mainly focus on Non functional like DB test, Load test, Volume Test,Security Test
				4) Usability Testing	-	It is mainly focus on usable matrix which is how the software is userfriendly.


7) Expain about UAT testing

			UAT Testing:
			--------------
				It is called as UserAcceptance Testing
				In this testing done by end user/Customer and Tester.
			This type of testing done in two level.

				1) Alpha - this is also test which is done by user in our environment.
				2) Beta - this is also test which is done by user in their environment.
