Software testing:
--------------------
It is the process of testing actual funalitity of the software.
In the software testing we test actual software.
Based on the four different testing level we test the software
	- GUI Testing
	- Usability Testing
	- Functional Testing
	-Non Funtional Testing


GUI Testing:
----------------
- In GUI testing we test UI of the application.
- We mainly test UI elements.
- UI elements are placed correctly or not.size of the elements,spelling,position,color etc.
- As per SRS document the elements are presented or not.
- GUI is the user interface so, this is the main think to attracting the user.

Usability Testing:
------------------
- In this Usability Testing we mainly focus on how easiliy educate the customers about the software
- We main test the Help button and help button functionalities.
- It is like user manual for helping the customer to know the software very well.

Functional testing:
----------------------
- In this testing is the most important phase in software testing.
- We actual test the functionality of the software whether it is stable or not.

There are various level of testing will be done in Functional testing.
	- Objects properties testing
	- Database testing
	- Error handing testing
	- calculation / Manupulation testing
	- Link existance / Link Execution
	- Cookies and Session Testing.


Object properties testing:
---------------------------
	- In this testing we mainly focus on properties of the object / Elements.
	- The elements fields are working correct or not.
	- Wheather it allows only requirements base input or not.
	- In object testing found objects are placed correctly and correct size or not.

Database testing:
---------------------
	- In the Database testing mainly focus on Database DML functions.
	- The DML functions like Create, Update, Delete, Select.
	- Wheather it will be done two levels one is front end part and other one is back end part.
	- Data base testing is called as gray box testing( Because the white and black box testing done in DB testing).
	- We must check the data insertion and deletion and updatiion of the table level.

Error handling Testing:
------------------------
	- In this testing found Error message or Error screen appear in correct manner or not
	- to found , While giving incorrect data the Error screen or error message appearance.
	- In this testing mainly use for user level of validation ( like username incorrect messages in log in screen).

Calculation / Manipulation testing:
-----------------------------------
	- In this testing performed most finacial base application
	- In this testing we mainly focus on wheather the application work calculation and produce correct output or not.

Link Existance / Link Executions:
----------------------------------
	- In this Testing we found Link test present correct manner or not. If it is present means whather it is placed correct position in screen.
	- While clicking the links wheather it goes to particular target page or not.
	- While clicking the links the link test color changed or not
	- In this testing mostly done in Web application and mobile application levels.

Cookies / Sessions Testing:
---------------------------
   Cookies testing:
   ----------------
	
	- In this cookies testing we need found wheather the given data stored in browser temporaly.
	- The store data will help to sortout the user process.
	- we need to check the cookies working correctly or not.
	
    Session testing:
    -----------------
	
	- In this session testing we need found the session timestamp is working correctly or not.
	- It help to secure the application
	- Most of the secured application will not allow user to stay long time . In that scenarios we actually used Session testing.

Non-Funtional Testing:
---------------------------
	After the complisation of the funcational testing we need to do non-functional testing.
   In the non-functional testing,
		1) Performance testing ( Load, Stress, Volume)
		2) Security testing
		3) Recovery testing
		4) Compatability testing
		5) Configration testing
		6) Installation testing
		7) sanitation / Garbage testing


1) Performance testing:
---------------------------
	In this testing we mainly focus on application performance.
This testing done in three different levels.
	1) Load testing : In the load testing we gradualy increase the load to test the software stable or not
	2) Stress testing : In this testing suddlly increase the load and decrease the load of the software to found wheather it is stable or not.
	3) volume testing : In this testing we need to found how much volume of data will transfered to DB. How much volume of the data will reterived.

2) Security testing:
-------------------------
	- In this security testing we mainly focuse on how the user data's are encrepted and decrepted.
	- In this testing we need to do hacking level of techniques to prevent the software.

3) Recovery testing:
------------------------
	- In this testing we found wheather the software recovery the data's easily or not.
	- While sudden low of software also, how the data's are stored and recovered. we need to check the think
	- For example Gmail Draft box.

4) Compatability testing:
-------------------------
	- In this testing we found wheather the created application is sutiable for all type of environments.
	- how the funcationality of application will work in other environument alos we need to check in this testing.

5) Configration testing:
-------------------------
	- In this testing we found configuration of the software wheather if new release also support for older configration.
	- We need to check how much RAM, Storage used for particular level of relesing software.
	- configration testing mainly define how the setup will be the particular verision of software release.

6) Installation testing:
---------------------------
	- In this level of testing we need to found wheather the installation process work correctly or not.
	- In this testing we need to found installation screen appear correctly or not. wheather it's user friendly or not.
	- In this testing we also uninstall the software wheather it remove all items are properly in system .

7) Sanitation / Garbage testing:
--------------------------------
	- In this testing we need found wheather the software build only for the customer requirments.If there is any other features means
	  we need to report to developers as a BUG.
	- the unwanted features Identified  from the software it is called garbage / sanitation testing.
