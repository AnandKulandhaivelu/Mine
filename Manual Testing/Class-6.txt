Test data desing techniques / Test case desing techniques
-------------------------------------------------------------
There are 5 ways mainly use to drive the test data

Those are,
	1) Equivalence class partioning (ECP)
	2) Boundry value analysis (BVA)
	3) Decision table
	4) State transiton
	5) Error Guessing

1) Equivalence class partioning (ECP):
--------------------------------------
	In this testing use to divide / partitioning the test data.
	In this method mainly use for reducing the test data and increasing the coverage limits.

Example : 
		input fields accpet values between 1-500 only.


normal test data		ECP method                ECP test data
-----------------		-----------		-----------------
1				-100 to o  -- invalid		-50
2				 1 to 100  -- valid		 30
3				 101 to 200 - valid		 150
.				     .
.				     .
.				     .
.				401 to 500  --valid		420
500				501 to 600  --invalid		580


we simply the test data based on the partition value. and then, cover all the level of inputs like valid and invalid.

2) Boundry value analysis (BVA):
------------------------------------
	In this boundry value analysis technique mainly focus on limited level of the data to be tested.

	In this scenarios we use valid test data, and invalid test data.

Example :
		Input fields accept values between 18 to 30 only

In the boundry value analysis techniques we normally use min value, min -1 value, min +1 value, Max value, Max-1 value, Max+1 value.

		
	Min -1:	17 -- invalid data
	Min   :	18 -- valid data
	Min +1:	19 -- valid data

	Max -1: 29 -- valid data
	Max   : 30 -- valid data
	Max +1: 31 -- invalid data.



The Equivalence class partioning / Boundry value analysis these two techniques are called as input field testing.



3) Decision table : 
------------------------
	In this Decision table techniques mainly focus on cause and effect.
	The testing methodology we use condition and action for the test data.In this decision table techniques is the easy way of writing Test cases.
	
Example :
		The requirements like need to fund transfer to another account.

Conditions :
--------------
	1) first condition is find out account verified or not.
	2) second condition is having sufficient money in the account or not.
	3) Third condition is While transfering money user able to get OTP authendication or not

Actions :
--------------
	1) All the three condition are true means transfer is intiated.
	2) If the OTP is not get the transfer declined.
	3) If the Insufficient money in account the transfer is declined.

Based on the condition and actions we need to write the Testcases.

4) State Transition:
------------------------
	In this State transition techniques.Data's depents on the State level.
	If the one state level is faild means the data flow will automatically move to end level of states.

Example : 
	
	State-1 : Valid input -----> (End state) Target
	State-2 : Invalid input ---> (Repeting once again) State 1
	State-3 : Invalid input ---> (Repeting once again) State 1
	  .
	  .
This will continue only for the certain levels.

	for example : Internet banking login scenario. we must try atleast 3 attempt only after that the session is expire.
		      We need to wait some time then only we process our request.

5) Error Guessing : 
-------------------
	In this Error Guessing methods fully based on the tester experiance level.
	The tester normal found the bug or defect without any documentation.
	while viewing the software functionality the tester identify some error in this techniques called as error guessing.

	Example :  Checking the buttons funtionality in softwares, Navigation of web pages.
