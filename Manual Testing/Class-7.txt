STLC- Software Testing Life Cycle
--------------------------------------
	- Software testing life cycle is one of the part of SDLC(Software Development Life Cycle)
	- When the testing phase is started we need to apply for STLC process.

STLC process have several parts:
		1) Test planning
		2) Test desing
		3) Test execution
		4) Bug / Defect reporting or tracking
		5) Test closure


1) Test planning:
------------------
	- This is first and for most process of the STLC process
	- In this phase we come to now how the process flow is, and find out project time line, test execution time line, environment setup.
	- In this test planning phase mainly involved project manager and team lead.
	- Test plan main desing based on the FRS and project documents.
	- Test planning focus on 
			What to test,
			How to test,
			When to test.
	
2) Test desing:
-------------------
	- This is second step in STLC process.
	- In this phase we know test scenarios and desing test cases.
	- Test case and test scenarios designed based on project documents, FRS,Use cases, Design documents.
	- In the test desing phase actual tesers and team lead involved.
	- When the test case process done. we have meeting with team and lead for apporving the test cases.
	- We need to create Requirment Tracable matrix (RTM) for found all the funcationality are covered under test.

3) Test Execution:
-------------------
	- This is the Third step in STLC process
	- In this phase we execute the approved or singoff testcases.
	- The test excution process start when the envirnoment setup done
	- The important aspect of the test execution is cover all tracable matrix scenrios.
	- In this phase most of tester invovle for testing the application.

4) Bug / Defect reporting:
---------------------------
	- This is the fourth level of step in STLC process.
	- While executing testcases if any mismatch or unexcepting result produced by the software means we need to address the developer as bug.
	- In this bug reporting process we maintain the data in seperatly. for raising bug valid / invalid and know bug status.
	- In this phase most of the tester involve to report the bug.
	- While reporting bug we get apporval for leads and managers.

5) Test closuer:
-------------------
	- This is last phase of STLC process.
	- While execution all the testcases and scenarios based on the requirement we need to submit the data to management.
	- What is tested and how it is tested and when it tested.
	- Based on the traceable matrix met we comeup with closer part.
	- In this stage we produced tracable matrix data, bug reporting data to management.
	- This stage also called as Test signoff.
