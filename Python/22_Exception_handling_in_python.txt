# Sample code for zero division error

try:                      # Try block
    print("Enter the 1st value :")
    x=int(input())
    print("Enter the 2nd value :")
    y=int(input())
    if y==0:
        raise Exception ("Division by zero is not work") # Raise the exceptions
    print(x/y)

except Exception as e:  # Except block
    print(e)

else:                  # else block
    print("This is not a zero division")

finally:              # final block
    print("This the final output")
