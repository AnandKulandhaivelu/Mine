Web services and API Testing
-----------------------------

What is client and server?
==================================
Cilent:
--------
	- It is actually get data from server.
	- request/ response the data
Server:
-------- 
	- It is actually Database and processing the data
	- It produce the data


Client server architecture
===============================
	- One tier Architecture ( server and cilent available in same system)
			example: Desktop Application
	- Two tier Architecture ( server is locate some where and cilent located some place)
			example: Cilent server Application
	- Three tier Architecture ( server, client, Web server(Business logic)) 
			example: Internet Application

Presentation, Business and Database layers
=============================================
	- Presentation Layer (GUI Testing)
		HTML5,Java Script,CSS
	- Application Layer ( API Testing)
		Java,c,c++,C#,Python
	- Database Layer ( Data base Testing)
		Mysql,Oracle,Sql,Mongu DB

What is request and response
=============================

	Request:
	---------
		Acknowledage the server with the piece of input
	Response:
	---------
		Receving msg or server will give some set of ouput based on the input.

What is API
=============
	- API Means Application Programming Interface
	- It help to communicate the data between two different software
	- Business Logic will present like API's
	- API will take request and response
	- It act as a interface between presentation and database layer.
	- Request as a input and Response as a output.

What is API Testing
==============================	
	- Testing the Application Layer via request and response that is called as
	API Testing

API Testing Vs Unit Testing
==============================

	API Testing				Unit Testing
     -----------------		    	    ---------------------
	Tester will perform 			Developer will perform

	End to End functional test		Separate function test

	Tester cannot access the code		Developer can access the code
	
	only API Functions are test		UI Testing is also involved

	All function tested			only basic function test

	Broader is scope			Limited in Scope

	It will run after the build		Usually ran before the build 
	create					

What is web service
========================
	- If the API is available means that is  called Web service
	- Web service API mantitory need internet.
	- It service over the web
	- Communicate the application over web
	- it provide standards format of communication
	- Platform Indepent communication
	example:
		All the payment gate way using webservice( paypal,paytm,phonepy, google pay etc..)
	like Zamato app work Scenario

	There are two types of webservices:
		- SOAP ( Simple Object Access Protocol)
				- It only support POST
				- It only support XML
			
		- REST ( REpresentational State Transfer)
				- It support POST,GET,PUT,DELETE....
				- It support XML/JSON/TEXT..


	Service Provider: Who will provide API
	Service Consumer: Who will Using API	
	
Difference between API and Webservices
============================================		
	Webservice is an API wrapped HTTP
	
	All Web Services are API but API are not Web services
	
	Web service might not perform all oprations that an API would perform
	
	A Web service need network while an API doesn't need a network for its operation.

Components of Web services(WSDL & UDDI)
===========================================	
	WSDL: Web service Description Language

		- It is normal in XML format files
		- It Describe location of API and it describe how to access the API.
		- SOAP service must have WSDL.

	UDDI: Universal Description and Discovery and Integration
		
		- It contains Multiple WSDL.
		- It is like Regiestry of contain all WSDL.		

Types of Web services
============================
	SOAP web services - POST
			  - XML format only support
	RESTful web services - GET,POST,PUT,DELETE 
			     - XML,HTML,JSON,TEXT.


	GET: I want to retrive data from DB.
	POST: We need to insert new data into DB.
	PUT: Update the data in DB.
	DELETE: Throw the API we delete the data in DB.


	HTTP: Hypertext transfer protocol 
		- This is not more sucure
		- SOAP and RESTful used this protocol service
		- No SSL

	HTTPS: Hypertext transfer protocol secure
		- This is secure 
		- Use SSL

Web services API Testing Tools:
=====================================

for Manual testing
--------------------	
	- SOAPUI
	- POST MAN
	- JMETER

for Automation
----------------
	- REST-assured
